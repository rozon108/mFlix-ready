We are going to redesign our web site, give it a asthethic vibe, option to sort movies by rating, category(genre).

Problem we are going to tackle :

      Deal with undefined. Some movie may not have certain data like movie poster(poster), rating or some other field. 
      


Things learned / i did: 
      
           Sorted movie by rating (ie. movie.imdb.rating)
          
 Made landing page:
